# Thesis

This repository contains files from my thesis project "Mixed Memory Q-Learner - an adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma". 
MMQL is a meta-strategy using a team of Q-learning players with different state-representations (in this context: memory length).

The Axelrod Python Library was used as a framework.
The strategy has not yet been committed to the library, but is put here for review.
